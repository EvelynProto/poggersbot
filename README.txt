1) make a new text file in the same folder as main.py

3) write "TOKEN=token" but replacing the lowercase token with your own (and removing the "quotation marks") inside of the text file

4) rename it to ".env" (not ".env.txt", just ".env")

5) remove the lines "from keep_alive import keep_alive" and "keep_alive()" from the main.py file

6) delete the keep_alive.py file

7) run main.py
